## AI Model Integration

To integrate your trained model:

1. Place your model files in the `ai-model` directory:
```
ai-model/
  ├── models/          # Trained model files
  ├── src/            # Model serving code
  ├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies
  └── Dockerfile      # Container configuration
```

2. Update the model endpoint in `.env`:
```
VITE_AI_MODEL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5000/predict
```

3. Implement the prediction endpoint in your model server:
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.json
    query = data['query']
    # Add your model inference code here
    response = your_model.predict(query)
    return jsonify({'response': response})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

4. Build and run the Docker container:
```bash
docker-compose up -d ai-model
```
